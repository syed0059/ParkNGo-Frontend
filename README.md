# Setting up Frontend

### Dependencies

Install NodeJS v18, it wil come with npm v9.

Install Docker, which comes with docker-compose, we'll use that to host mongodb on our local machine.

Install Expo Go app from https://expo.dev/client

### Set up

If setting up for the first time, change the terminal location to the Frontend folder and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies for the app.

To try running the app, run `npm start`, there should be a QR code in the terminal. Scan the QR code with Expo Go (Android) or the Camera app (iOS)

To close everything, just end the process on the terminal using ctrl+c.

- **Chatbot**: The pet which the user acquires from the gacha machine acts as the chatbot for users to interact with it to answer questions, help employees plan their time as well as HR solutions for them (when they face problems but do not feel like they can turn to anyone). It can also be used to do some day-to-day admin tasks such as coming up with emails for the user to apply for leave.<br/>

</div>

- **User Profile**: Users will have their own avatar and pet, which they can gain experience points through completing tasks and winning team games as well to increase their levels on Ascendo. This is to allow users to gain a sense of satisfaction and to see some progress as they complete the tasks which will make it seem less mundane.<br/><br/>
