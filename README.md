# Setting up Frontend

### Dependencies

Install NodeJS v18, it wil come with npm v9.

Install Docker, which comes with docker-compose, we'll use that to host mongodb on our local machine.

Install Expo Go app from https://expo.dev/client

### Set up

If setting up for the first time, change the terminal location to the Frontend folder and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies for the app.

To try running the app, run `npm start`, there should be a QR code in the terminal. Scan the QR code with Expo Go (Android) or the Camera app (iOS)

To close everything, just end the process on the terminal using ctrl+c.
